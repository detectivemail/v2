While you might think this was an act by the political beneficiaries of his death, everyone here, including officer McGill taking a sip of his morning coffee at the Dublin Police Department, is absolutely sure that it\u2019s not. The case very certainly needed higher investigation, and so he had to make a call. He and his detective team had to reach a satisfactory reason, possibly with names, of the murder within 48-72 hours or risk being suspended. So he sought advice from his senior, and they both agreed upon bringing two qualified foreign detectives to help them investigate the case.<\/p>\n<p>Detective Mr. Alexander Ivan from the Russian Crimes &amp; Forensics Branch and detective Kevin Miles from the New York Police Department arrived at Dublin on the first available flight to Dublin the next day. Though officer McGill wasn\u2019t that worried about a Russian and an American working together, his senior did alert him about some of the problems he may have to face because of the distinct difference in nationalities. Although there was nothing, he could do as these two detectives were assigned by the higher security intelligence of the Irish Government upon his senior\u2019s request. The detectives took different flights, but they were staying in two adjacent rooms of the same hotel.<\/p>\n<p>At Dublin PD;<\/p>\n<p>Officer McGill: Detective Miles, please take a seat.<br>Mr. Miles: Thank you, officer. So, I heard it\u2019s pretty bad.<br>McGill: (Exhaling) It is. And the worst part is, we still have no clue on why, nothing at all.<br>Miles: Don\u2019t worry, officer, we\u2019ll find out something.<br>McGill: We better do.<br>Miles: Um, by the way, I heard the other guy\u2019s Russian.<br>McGill: Yeah, I know, look, Mr. Alex is a great detective. And it\u2019s just one case, don\u2019t make any trouble, will you?<br>Miles: Oh, I\u2019ll try my best, officer. But you know Russians.<br>McGill: So, we could\u2019ve declared that it was suicide but, OESZA.<br>Miles: What is that?<br>McGill: Some kind of Criminal Organization, I don\u2019t know. It was written with white paint on the street exactly where he died.<br>Miles: And you said there was no political involvement; why?<br>McGill: That is because MP Smith was a great guy. He had no competitors in Dublin in the last election. His family confirmed that he also had no such enmity with anyone that they could recall.<br>Miles: Understood.<\/p>\n<p>Miles met the other detective, Mr. Ivan, in the hotel lobby. He would get his stuff from his room to investigate the crime scene, but he then thought they\u2019ll both go together.<\/p>\n<p>Miles: Hi, you must be detective Alex, from your Russian looks.<br>Alexander: First time we speak, and you had to bring that up.<br>Miles: Yeah. You must be 5 years older than me.<br>Alexander: And I request you behave that way.<br>Miles: Hum, okay.<br>Alexander: Now, do you have any updates on the case?<br>Miles: OESZA, that\u2019s all we got.<br>Alexander: No relevant information on Google?<br>Miles: Nope.<br>Alexander: Let\u2019s go.<\/p>\n<p>They both reached the crime scene a few moments later. Alex started looking at the place of death highlighted by the cops. The area was nicely taped, and it was actually in the middle of a street-side market.<\/p>\n<p>Alex: The criminal was an expert shooter. Could\u2019ve shot anyone else, but he didn\u2019t miss his target. This is definitely a criminal organization.<br>Miles: Could be a hitman.<br>Alex: You mean assassin?<br>Miles: Yes.<br>Alex: No. Assassins ought to take less risk. He could\u2019ve shot him anywhere else, but he shot him here. In the middle of a market. Makes me think it was some sort of a distraction.<br>Miles: Create a distraction by killing the MP? Obviously, no way.<br>Alex: Unless, of course, OESZA wants to prove a point.<br>Miles: What kind of pint?<br>Alex: That they are capable of doing something like this.<br>Miles: Interesting. And what do you think they\u2019ll gain by proving this point?<br>Alex: Fear.<\/p>\n<p>They examined the place for any suspicious objects but found nothing.<\/p>\n<p>Miles: The forensic results just came out.<br>Alex: M24?<br>Miles: Yes. How did you know?<br>Alex: The way his body fell tells us the angle he was shot. Look, top right corner. This means he was shot precisely from the opposite direction or the other supplementary angle.<br>Miles: Oh. And which is that way.<br>Alex: Exactly. And then look at the tall buildings that way. Two buildings. But the bullet wasn\u2019t shot from the roof. Because first of all, it\u2019s not that tall, and secondly, shooting him on the ground would mean lowering his gun quite a bit, which would mean someone definitely seeing him during the shot.<br>Miles: But the police confirmed that there were no eye suspects.<br>Alex: Yes, so, the shot was from that building, as the other building has permanently fixed glass windows and breaking any window would also mean an eye suspect though the shot was silenced.<br>Miles: Okay. So the shot was from that building, but how does that explain the type of the rifle?<br>Alex: I\u2019m starting to think you are a novice, detective Miles. Images of the wound show the exact size of the bullet. And the distance of his body from the blood confirms that it was rather an M24, not an AWM.<br>Miles: All agreed. Except that I\u2019m a novice.<br>Alex: Oh please, 15 cases, 10 successful. That might be satisfactory, but the inadequate amount of numbers shows your lack of experience.<br>Miles: Hum, so you researched me.<br>Alex: Of course I did; I\u2019m not Sherlock Holmes.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>They both reached the morgue with officer McGill to watch Mr. Smith\u2019s body more closely for any more details. Detective Miles has done a few courses on medical inspection, so he starts watching for bruises while Alex and officer McGill speak about the case.<\/p>\n<p>McGill: Detective Alex, the OESZA writing on the road, the whole thing was planned by someone who knew exactly where he would be that day.<br>Alex: Yes. And for that, I\u2019d need the CCTV footage.<br>McGill: I already saw that but found nothing to get on to. The angle of the CCTV doesn\u2019t cover the exact place. There are about a thousand people buying things in that street.<br>Alex: Oh, no. I want the one on a block before, the connecting street with the main road. McGill: Okay. But, what will you do with that?<br>Alex: I have to see something. Miles, found anything?<br>Miles: No. The body is clean, no bruises, nothing.<br>Alex: Okay.<\/p>\n<p>The CCTV footage arrived, and Alex saw it until they got Mr. Smith on the footage.<\/p>\n<p>Alex: There. That\u2019s all we need.<br>McGill: What?<br>Alex: That small speed breaker, it\u2019s too hard to notice. I noticed that detective Miles here tripped on that. If he hadn\u2019t, I also would\u2019ve. It\u2019s just too hard to notice.<br>Miles: Respectfully agreed.<br>McGill: Wait a minute, I also tripped there.<br>Alex: See the footage. About 2 in 5 people trip on that breaker. Point proved.<br>McGill: And those who don\u2019t?<br>Miles: Their locales, or maybe they walk on this route every day.<br>Alex: Yes, exactly. Mr. Smith\u2019s office isn\u2019t that way; his home is also not this way. But, he used this road every day; for some reason. And the killer knew that. Which means he followed him for a few days to know his routine.<br>McGill: But my question is, why exactly here?<br>Miles: Oh, detective Alex already figured that out. OESZA is trying to make a name for itself.<br>McGill: Oh, God, I hope not.<br>Alex: Come on, let\u2019s find the building where he was shot from.<\/p>\n<p>They again arrive at the crime scene. Detective Alex stands at the point of the shot to find out the exact angle.<\/p>\n<p>Miles: That\u2019s impossible, mate.<br>Alex: Ah, I\u2019m not your mate.<br>Miles: Oh yes, you are, detective Ivaraf.<br>Alex: You\u2019re not supposed to know that name.<br>Miles: Well, now I do.<br>Alex: Okay, no big deal, you googled me. Congratulations! Now you know I\u2019m a great detective.<br>Miles: Yes. But would you even tell that yourself after the Berlin triple murder case?<br>Alex: (Shocked) that\u2019s not in google, is it?<br>Miles: No. But I\u2019m not going to tell you how I got it.<br>Alex: I\u2019ll find out myself.<br>Miles: Yeah, good luck with that.<\/p>\n<p>They went to the third floor and stopped.<\/p>\n<p>Alex: The shot must\u2019ve been from 3D-<br>Miles: 3F, or 4D or 4F.<br>Alex: Yes.<br>Miles: Now?<br>Alex: Now we observe the people in these rooms. Because I believe anyone from these four flats is directly related to the murder.<\/p>\n<p>They knock at each of the flats and found two families at 3D and 3F. Families can\u2019t be related to this, so they move on to 4D and 4F. 4D was locked with no one living, so it was more or less suspicious, but they decided to check on that after confirming whether it was 4F or not. A person opened the door after they knocked.<\/p>\n<p>4F guy: Yes, how may I help you?<br>Alex: We\u2019re from your ISP, and we need to check your room\u2019s wires as we think there might be a leak, and we need to find that.<br>4F guy: But I use cellular data.<br>Alex: Oh. In that case, there still might be a problem with the wires. Can we just check?<\/p>\n<p>They checked the window, too, while acting like checking the wires. They got out without letting him know that they weren\u2019t from the ISP.<\/p>\n<p>Miles: (On the corridor) what do you think?<br>Alex: He might be our guy.<br>Miles: But I saw no traces of gunpowder.<br>Alex: Yes, but I know that. But else you didn\u2019t saw?<br>Miles: What?<br>Alex: Dust. This week\u2019s weather has been quite windy in Dublin, and the wind flows with speed through exactly this Northeast angle in this area, which is supposed to bring dust from outside.<br>Miles: Wow, um, maybe he cleaned it.<br>Alex: Oh, come on, he\u2019s 25 max and lives alone. People don\u2019t clean dust unless they have OCD, which he doesn\u2019t, telling by how his room was.<br>Miles: So you\u2019re confident.<br>Alex: Yeah, but just got to make sure of one more thing first. Since when he has been staying and where he works. Just to confirm.<\/p>\n<p>They asked the building owner for more details on the 4F guy, and they got to know that he got in the apartment just a week ago and told them that he\u2019d leave after a couple of months. They came out and started thinking.<\/p>\n<p>Miles: Renting this flat for two months is too long for this case, Alex.<br>Alex: No, he has to at least avoid suspicion from the cops. He\u2019s being paid in full for the stay by OESZA.<br>Miles: So he\u2019s not the shooter?<br>Alex: No. His body isn\u2019t the type who could shoot an M24 on a professional level. But he did look worried when we were checking the windows, you saw?<br>Miles: Yeah. We should arrest this guy.<\/p>\n<p>They went up and knocked on 4F, but no one opened. After waiting for 3 minutes, Miles broke the lock. As supposed, no one was inside. They quickly looked down the window and could find the 4F guy sliding through the pipe and started running away. So they both went after him climbing down the stairs. The chase was on. But he was getting far away. So detective Miles stopped and aimed his gun at him and shot. But he missed, and the guy ran away into more people in a busy street. They searched, but couldn\u2019t find him, so they went back to Dublin PD.<\/p>\n<p>McGill: Andy O\u2019Brian. Not from this city. But we will find him.<br>Miles: He heard us and ran away.<br>McGill: Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get him.<br>Alex: But you won\u2019t get any information off him.<br>McGill: Why?<br>Alex: Because you\u2019ll find him dead. If they could kill the MP in public, they\u2019d kill him anywhere, just not to risk the leakage of any more information about their gang.<br>McGill: Oh. But I disagree with you, Mr. Alex. And supposing even if they intend to do that, I believe we\u2019ll find him before they can.<br>Alex: Let\u2019s just wait and watch.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4466459 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4466459\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\"><p>MAKE A DEDUCTION<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-669d44b elementor-widget elementor-widget-toggle\" data-id=\"669d44b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"toggle.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle\" role=\"tablist\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-1071\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-1071\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-caret-right\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-caret-up\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" class=\"elementor-toggle-title\">OFFICER McGILL IS RIGHT<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-1071\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-1071\">Wrong.<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-1072\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"2\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-1072\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-caret-right\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-caret-up\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" class=\"elementor-toggle-title\">DETECTIVE ALEX IS RIGHT<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-1072\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"2\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-1072\">Detective Alex is right.\n\nThe boy was found dead the same day.
