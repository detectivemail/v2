The state&#8217;s security division was somewhat impressed by the two foreign detectives&#8217; works and wanted to keep them anyway. And accordingly, a one-year contract for the detectives was sent to both their respective countries with a view of additional investigation and related help in the upcoming months. Though Alex and Miles would never willingly agree to stay, the paycheck was interesting enough to convince them. And even before they could realize how big an opportunity this was for them to enhance their career experience to another level, a bank robbery in the adjacent city made them re-think if the amount of money they were being paid was actually great.<br \/><br \/>McGill: 100 million dollars.<br \/>Miles: What?<br \/>McGill: Yes. Stolen. No alarm, no breaking-ins, no security breach, nothing! The money, it&#8217;s gone.<br \/>Alex: It&#8217;s been hacked and sent somewhere else by wire transfer.<br \/>McGill: Yes. But hacking doesn&#8217;t falsify that it was stolen. It was. And now, somehow, we&#8217;re responsible.<br \/>Miles: What? That&#8217;s absolutely insane. We have nothing to do. It didn&#8217;t even happen in our city.<br \/>McGill: Yeah, right. Try explaining that to people who lost their money. I think this is it. I&#8217;m unofficially suspended. They&#8217;re going to suspend three officers.<br \/>Alex: Oh, you guys are so wrong. We can do something. Come on, I know a guy.<br \/><br \/>Detective Alex took them to a house at a corner of Dublin. A guy opened the door as they knocked.<br \/><br \/>Guy: How may I help you \u2013 oh hey! Alex! How&#8217;s it going?<br \/>Alex: Fine, Johann. I need your help.<br \/>Johann: Oh yeah, absolutely \u2013 come in.<br \/><br \/>They went to Johann&#8217;s room, and it was a mess. He had this server, a highly powerful computer with triple adjusted monitors and all for \u2013 coding and gaming. He had this long blonde hair, a tall face, and by the looks, you can guess \u2013 a typical nerd. The round glasses again verify the statement.<\/p><p>Johann: So uh, your mates seem tense. What&#8217;s the problem?<br \/>Alex: 100 million dollars have been stolen. From Drogheda.<br \/>Johann: Yeah \u2013 I know, I know. So, it&#8217;s been hacked, I read.<br \/>Alex: Yes. Hacked. Now, we are assigned to find out who it is and where the money is. It&#8217;s a lot of money, Johann. The money of the people. We have to find him.<br \/>Miles: Are you going to help us?<br \/>Johann: Yes, of course, of course. Now. If you wanna know who it was, you have to first figure out how he did it.<br \/>Alex: Tell us.<br \/>Johann: (deep breath) you see, wire transfers are made with servers like TransFast. They are highly secure and maintain a very efficient level of encryption protocol. The greatest of the hackers have tried, but it&#8217;s something that cannot be hacked.<br \/>Alex: So how&#8217;s it even possible? You&#8217;re saying no one can hack that?<br \/>Johann: Yes, yes, exactly. Unless \u2013<br \/>Alex: Unless what?<br \/>Johann: You have help from the inside.<br \/>Alex: Oh. I see.<br \/>McGill: So someone in the bank helped the hacker.<br \/>Johann: Yeah, but it&#8217;s not just someone. Someone with access to the Bank&#8217;s TransFast account. Now obviously, the suspicion goes to that officer. But you don&#8217;t have proof. Because the statistics would never recall him making that transfer.<br \/>McGill: So, that proves he didn&#8217;t do it?<br \/>Johann: No, you cannot say that he didn&#8217;t do it. He might&#8217;ve done it, might not. But the security was breached. And in these cases, obviously from a computer with a hidden IP address. Now, it isn&#8217;t that easy. (Smiles) otherwise, for a hundred million dollars, I would&#8217;ve done it myself.<br \/>McGill: (Clears throat).<br \/>Johann: Anyway, so, you guys know about the password hashing algorithm?<br \/>Miles: No idea.<br \/>Johann: It&#8217;s like, umm, whenever you create a password into an account, the password itself isn&#8217;t saved how it was precisely typed.<br \/>Alex: So?<br \/>Johann: So, um, what the algorithm does is that it takes in the input and converts the characters into a string of unknown numbers and variables. That&#8217;s what hashes like \u2013 MD5 and SHA-1 have been doing to this date.<br \/>Miles: Okay\u2026.<br \/>Johann: So um, it does that because if, and only if the site has a data breach, which can be easy to do for professional hackers; it doesn&#8217;t reveal the actual password. The password remains hidden. So whenever I say he had help from the inside, I mean he actually somehow got that data breach.<br \/>Alex: Okay, so he couldn&#8217;t do the whole work even with someone&#8217;s help?<br \/>Johann: Exactly! He still has to figure out the hash. And as for hashes, it&#8217;s a non-reversible function.<br \/>Alex: So? How he did it?<br \/>Johann: So, he has to be legit. What I mean is that either yes, he can use a probable wordlist with random passwords, but (laugh) you know, he&#8217;s not Sherlock Holmes. And the recent algorithms make it compulsory to add numbers and symbols to your password.<br \/>Miles: You&#8217;re saying he couldn&#8217;t have guessed the password?<br \/>Johann: Yeah, that&#8217;s about what I meant. So, he&#8217;s a hacker. He might do other than that, search for most commonly used words for passwords, and then get those respective hashes to match his breached data. If he&#8217;s lucky and anyone matches, he&#8217;s in! Then he can do things- like, transfer the money. 100 Mill is just a number. He just needed to press a single button, and that&#8217;s all then.<br \/>McGill: (Laughs) sounds about easy to me, but is that all?<\/p><p>Johann: Well, no. Because, um, yeah, first of all, he needs to be lucky enough to have the matching hash in his commonly used hashes database. I mean, a password can be literally anything, from your dog&#8217;s name to your favourite pornstar. There&#8217;s no database large enough to hold so many hashes, and even if it does, he&#8217;s gonna have a minimal number of attempts until the page crashes and the security breach attempt is notified to the people responsible for it. But they didn&#8217;t report anything like that, did they?<br \/>McGill: Nope.<br \/>Miles: What if they are included?<br \/>McGill: Why would they be included? It&#8217;s their bank, damn it!<br \/>Miles: Still, 100 Mill is a large number, don&#8217;t you think?<br \/>Johann: Come on, guys, if it was them, they wouldn&#8217;t even need to hack it in the first place. They&#8217;d just override and hit send, and that&#8217;s all.<br \/>Alex: We&#8217;ll investigate them. But I&#8217;d like you to continue. There&#8217;s no other way around?<br \/>Johann: Nothing that I can recall. But wait. I wasn&#8217;t finished.<br \/>Alex: What do you mean?<br \/>Johann: Salting algorithm. Now, modern sites use their sorting algorithm to mess with the hash, just for their last support.<br \/>Miles: What is that?<br \/>Johann: It&#8217;s like a hidden phrase of some random characters. Say, if their TransFast uses the salting algorithm of like, &#8217;22A9@&#8217;, this particular phrase will be hiddenly added to any area of the hashed password. Like, it can even be in the middle. And the hash is saved likewise. So, in that case, what happens is that, even if you found the hash with a breach, you can&#8217;t figure out the actual hash, neither the actual word. Because you don&#8217;t know their salting phrase and where it is used.<br \/>Alex: So much information. It just makes sense. No. It doesn&#8217;t add up. He must&#8217;ve had help from the inside.<br \/>Johann: Well, not necessarily. I mean, 1st class hackers can somehow create the breach themselves. But it&#8217;s pretty much all in the later part. Now you guys do remember that there have been instances like 15-year-old&#8217;s breaking into US intelligence chiefs and getting access to highly confidential information and further leaking it online. That&#8217;s what someone gifted with the knowledge of computers can do. I mean, I can try my whole life and not even get close to breaching a regular website, while a 15-year-old teenager can do that! You know what I mean?<br \/>Alex: I understand. He must be either someone very close to one of the bank&#8217;s managers to indirectly override the system somehow, with his help, without even letting him know. Or, he&#8217;s nothing but a pure hidden behind a computer screen.<br \/>Johann: I mean, yeah, yeah, um, that&#8217;s precisely how you can say that.<br \/>Alex: We should go to the bank.<br \/>McGill: Thank you, Mr. Johann. For your help. We&#8217;ll be contacting you again if necessary. Hope you don&#8217;t mind.<br \/>Johann: Oh, no. Not at all. I&#8217;ll be happy to help. I&#8217;ll do anything for my friend Alex here. After all, he saved me from jail once.<br \/>Miles: How? You&#8217;re in Berlin, and he&#8217;s from Russia.<br \/>Alex: That, Mr. Miles, I&#8217;ll tell you another day. Let&#8217;s go.<br \/>Johann: (Smiles) hmm.<\/p><p>The detectives and Officer McGill then reached the bank in their adjacent city.<br \/>McGill: (Showing badge to reception) Dublin PD, we need to talk with the manager.<br \/><br \/>They all then walked into the manager&#8217;s room. The manager was mid-aged, about 45. Whitebeard, dead-eye, looks under the glasses. The conversation oddly started as the manager looked and sounded pissed.<br \/><br \/>Manager: Where&#8217;s my money?<br \/>Alex: Oh, your money?<br \/>McGill: Detective Alex.<br \/>Manager: Yes, my money. I&#8217;ve hard-worked for this bank and put in many investments to build a reputation, and now they just come and told me that a 100 million dollar is gone! Just like that?<br \/>Miles: Obviously, you&#8217;re not in a good mindset right now. But you have to understand, there was a failure in your system.<br \/>Manager: What? My system? No, no, no, no, no\u2026.. I&#8217;ve seen bank managers who come to work and just sleep all day around sitting in their office. I don&#8217;t do that. I come here and pay attention to my staff and make sure they get work done. And yes, I am the one who&#8217;s robbed\u201410 years of glowing reputation.<br \/>Alex: Calm down. Introduce us to your staff because if you have a chance to get back your money, we have to work fast before the thief is gone with the money.<br \/>Manager: Okay. I just want it back. Anyhow. Please, detectives, do what you have to do. I&#8217;ll tell them to make a row.<br \/><br \/>Alex and Miles interrogated each of the staff to find nervous weaknesses and if they tried to lie or avoid any of their questions. Basically, simple questions like their work were in the bank and related to the money-transfer-server. They found two people held responsible for the money-transfer-server. But then again, the computer doesn&#8217;t recall them making any such transactions and yes, if they did, it can&#8217;t be deleted. It doesn&#8217;t work like that. So, you cannot accuse someone of doing something that has no legal proof. By their tone and accent, they seem pretty nervous but not as if guilty scared. Just nervous. So the detectives decided to leave it as it is for the day, as officer McGill was only informed about another case that happened somewhere. They equally agreed on surveilling the men related to the money transfer server, just in case something comes out. Else, they&#8217;ll just have to proceed to a higher investigation to find out if someone actually did, then who it could be, to leak the password in the first place.<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4466459 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"4466459\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\"><p>MAKE A DEDUCTION<\/p><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-669d44b elementor-widget elementor-widget-toggle\" data-id=\"669d44b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"toggle.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle\" role=\"tablist\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-toggle-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-title-1071\" class=\"elementor-tab-title\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"elementor-tab-content-1071\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon elementor-toggle-icon-left\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-closed\"><i class=\"fas fa-caret-right\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened\"><i class=\"elementor-toggle-icon-opened fas fa-caret-up\"><\/i><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" class=\"elementor-toggle-title\">HOW TO TRACE THE HACKER?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"elementor-tab-content-1071\" class=\"elementor-tab-content elementor-clearfix\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"elementor-tab-title-1071\"><p>They can just tell Johann to make a shortlist of the number of possible hackers he knows in the province who might do the job.
